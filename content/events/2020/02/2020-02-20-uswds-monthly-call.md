For this month's U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) monthly call Dan Williams, product lead, will discuss the design system in greater detail. Time will be set aside for a live Q&A session between attendees and Dan.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
