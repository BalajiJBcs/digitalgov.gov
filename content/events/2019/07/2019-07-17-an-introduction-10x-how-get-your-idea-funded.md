Do you work on a product or service in government that has an effect on the public? Do you have an idea for how to transform a product or service to make the government better or more effective?

{{< img-right src="10x-funded-cover" >}}

**Join us this Wednesday, July 17 at 2pm ET** to learn how you can get your idea funded through [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) — the new investment fund for technology products in the government from the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS) office at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA). 10x funds new ideas to help the government deliver better products and services.
